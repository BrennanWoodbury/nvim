# Neovim Starter

## Configurations

* [00-minimal](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/00-minimal): Small configuration without third party plugins.
* [01-base](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/01-base): Small configuration that includes a plugin manager. It can provide a good base to start your own configuration.
* [02-opinionated](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/02-opinionated): Opinionated configuration. It includes a combination of popular plugins. For the people who are looking to make Neovim their main editor but don't want to start from scratch. Plugins related to "code intellisense" are not included in this config.
* [03-lsp](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/03-lsp): Example configuration showing how to configure the built-in LSP client with autocompletion. It is based on `02-opinionated`.
* [04-lsp-installer](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/04-lsp-installer): Same as `03-lsp` but uses [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) to install language servers.
* [05-modular](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/05-modular): Same as `04-lsp-installer` but everything is split in modules.
